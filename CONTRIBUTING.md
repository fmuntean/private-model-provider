# Contributing to Private Model Provider

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Private Model Provider! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm 9.x or later
- VS Code 1.106.0 or later
- Git

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fmuntean/private-model-provider.git
   cd private-model-provider
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the extension**
   ```bash
   npm run esbuild
   ```

4. **Run in development mode**
   - Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host
   - Or run `npm run esbuild-watch` for continuous builds

5. **Package the extension (VSIX)**
    ```bash
    npm run package
    ```
    This runs `vsce package --no-yarn` (vsce is a dev‑dependency). It creates a `.vsix` file (e.g., `private-model-provider-1.1.3.vsix`) in the project root. You can install it locally via **Extensions → Install from VSIX...** or publish it to the Marketplace with `npm run deploy`.

## Code Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

- Use strict TypeScript mode
- Prefer `const` over `let` when possible
- Use explicit type annotations for function parameters and return types
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint)

### Error Handling

- Always use the `GatewayError` class for custom errors
- Log errors with appropriate levels (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`)
- Provide user-friendly error messages via VS Code notifications

### Security

- Never log sensitive information (API keys, tokens)
- Use `SecretStorage` for storing credentials
- Validate all external input

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments to all public methods
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Add screenshots to assets/ folder for new UI features
- Update docs/API.md when changing internal APIs

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start an inference server (e.g., vLLM, Ollama)
2. Launch the extension in debug mode (`F5`)
3. Open Copilot Chat and select a model from Private Model Provider
4. Test various scenarios:
   - Basic chat completion
   - Tool calling
   - Error handling (stop the server, invalid config)

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Extension activates without errors
- [ ] Models are fetched from inference server
- [ ] Chat completions stream correctly
- [ ] Tool calls work with compatible models
- [ ] Configuration changes apply without restart
- [ ] API key is stored securely
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Status bar menu displays correct server status
- [ ] Server preset configuration works correctly
- [ ] All commands in feature menu execute properly
